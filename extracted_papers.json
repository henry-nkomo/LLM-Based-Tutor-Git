She also \nhappens to be a hippo. \n As a newborn, she was washed up on the banks of the Selati River in \nHoedspruit during the 2000 floods.  She was rescued by former game ranger, \nTonie Joubert, who lives beside the river.  He says he first thought Jessica \nwas a pig because she was pink, except she had a very wide mouth.  She still \nhad her umbilical cord attached and weighed 16 kg.  Today, Jessica weighs a hefty 900 kg and eats about 90 kg of food a day. \n \n'Her favourite food is dog pellets and peanuts.  She's also very fond of lettuce, \nsweet potatoes and mealies and we give her coffee twice a day.  She plays in \nthe river with my kids and the dogs whenever she can,' says Joubert.  \nWhen Jessica is hungry, she doesn't hesitate to use her massive mouth to \nturn door handles and enter the house.  She then makes her way to the \nkitchen to get some food fr om Tonie's wife, Shirley. \n Jessica can understand the Jouberts very well.  They speak to her in \nAfrikaans and when Shirley says, ' Bek, bek'  ('Mouth, mouth'), Jessica opens \nher mouth wide for a handful of treats.  The Jouberts' nine dogs are all Jessica's playmates.  And when the Jouberts have to spend time away from home, they organise a babysitter for her. \nWhen they come back, Jessica gets very  excited.  It is common for her to \nwalk over to their bedroom window in the mornings and make noises calling \nthem to come out.  She's no longer allowed to sleep inside the house \nbecause she climbs on beds and breaks them.  \nJessica is so charming that BONA  photographer, Jean Mortlock, couldn't stop \nherself from jumping into the river with her and giving her a big kiss.

    "passage": "OUR CLASSROOM HEROES\n\nThis is a review of a new book celebrating great teachers. It shows that all is not bad in South African education.\n\nGreat South African Teachers is not about failing schools, troubled children or bad teachers. It is a collection of stories from current and former school children. They celebrate the outstanding South African teachers who transformed their lives. This book tells stories about great educators who come from rich and poor schools, from former-white schools and still-black schools, from the big cities and the small villages.\n\nThey are great in different ways. There are the subject teachers who impress young minds with their teaching skills. There are the teachers experienced in life who help make the connection between classroom learning and preparation for life. There are the extended parents who care not only for the minds of children but for their hearts as well. These are the 'extra-mile' teachers who take on duties of caring beyond their job descriptions. There are courageous stories that tell of teachers who risked their jobs to teach outside the official syllabus during the years of apartheid. Great teachers have one thing in common: they leave a lasting impression on the lives of young people.\n\nThe book started with a simple invitation in The Sunday Times: 'Submit a story about the teacher who made the greatest impact on your life.' Within days, many stories flooded in. It seemed as if people had been waiting for the chance to share their memories of educators who had changed their lives. The book is both challenging and fulfilling.\n\nGreat South African Teachers is challenging because it raises awkward questions. Is it possible that there was a golden era of schooling in South Africa during the apartheid years? Besides the political atmosphere and the restrictions of that time, one gets the distinct idea that many township schools were very productive. Dedicated teachers made sure that children were not disadvantaged in the learning process. The tunnel-view that there were constant pupil uprisings in the past may be misleading. Even in those difficult years, many teachers understood the dangers of 'Liberation now, education later'.\n\nWe have become exhausted by stories of defeat in schools. We are tired of results that show that our children cannot read and write at the expected level. We worry about young people who drop out of school and get into all kinds of trouble. We are concerned about huge government spending on schools for minimal results. This is why the book is fulfilling. It will lift your spirits with the simple message: even though learning material matters, dedicated teachers matter more. As the stories show, teachers are our most important learning resource.\n\nThe book brings back our faith in schooling. It shows that there is hope. This hope is based on good teachers. So this book can show many student teachers which qualities have a positive influence on learning and living. It can inform school governing bodies of the appropriate standards to use when employing teachers. It can enable the government to develop a teacher-education system based on what learners see as important qualities.\n\nGreat South African Teachers will hopefully convey the message that the foundations of democracy and decency are built by dedicated teachers. It is important for the youth to know that teaching is a calling. Many choose it, not because of the material benefits they can obtain, but because of the social benefits that they can give to pupils and society. Many of the great teachers in this book had options but chose teaching because they could make a difference.\n\nThe book celebrates teachers who make the important difference between hope and despair in the lives of 12 million school children in South Africa.\n\n[Adapted from an article by J Jansen, Sunday Times, 9 October, 2011]",

    "passage": "ORGANIC FARMING – WHY THE FUSS?\n\nWe often hear people talk about organic food and see it on shop shelves but many of us do not know exactly what organic food is and why it is so expensive. Is it really better? And is eating organic food a healthier option?\n\nOrganic food is food that has been produced naturally, using only natural substances such as earth and water. No chemical fertilisers or poisons are used and the food is 100% natural.\n\nModern farming involves a lot more than just hoping for rain – it is a science. Thanks to scientific developments during the past decades, farmers can now produce larger quantities of food. They can, for example, feed animals hormones to make them healthier or fatter. On chicken farms, fowls are kept in small enclosures and given special food to make them and their eggs bigger.\n\nCrop farmers can use seed that has been specifically developed to provide large harvests. To prevent their crops from being infected with pests and diseases, crop farmers spray insecticides and other chemicals on the fields.\n\nBut for some time now researchers have been wondering what quantities of these substances land up in our food and how dangerous they are. They started looking at farming methods and soon discovered that these were also harmful to the environment. Good soil contains minerals and very small living creatures among the plants. This is just one of the miracles around us: these small creatures take something from the soil but they also put nutrients back which can in turn be used by something else. This ensures a perfect life cycle in the soil and keeps it healthy and fertile.\n\nWhen the natural cycle of these life forms in the soil is disturbed by the addition of chemical substances, it causes an imbalance. The ground becomes less fertile and requires more chemical fertiliser to make it fertile again. This causes a vicious circle: the more chemicals damage the soil, the more chemicals are needed to supplement it again. This is not ideal as poisons are harmful to the environment.\n\nOrganic farming really means that farmers are returning to the 'good old ways' of doing things. By not using chemicals, organic farmers give the environment a chance to recover naturally and at the same time they are producing food that is free from chemicals.\n\nOrganic farmers use natural methods and work with nature instead of against it. They plant different crops each year so that the nutrients in the soil do not become depleted. Animals, birds and insects are used to control pests. Ladybirds are very popular among organic farmers as they eat the plant lice that damage crops. Natural remedies are used to prevent or treat diseases and animals are allowed to wander and graze freely. Their dung fertilises the soil. Compost is made using animal droppings and plant material which is worked into the soil. Chickens are free-range and can move around scratching for food. A well-functioning organic farm is a natural environment all on its own.\n\nIf it is so simple, why is all food not organically produced? South Africa is still far behind other countries when it comes to organic farming methods. Many South African farmers are hesitant to change their old ways and need to be persuaded to switch to organic farming. There are currently 200 certified organic farms in our country. We do have organisations that control organic farms. They inspect the farms to ensure organic principles are followed.\n\nWhen you buy organic food, make sure it carries a label which reads 'certified organic'. If the label is not there, you may be paying for something which is not what it pretends to be.\n\n[Adapted from YOU, 27 July 2012]",

    "passage": "OUR CLASSROOM HEROES\n\nThis is a review of a new book celebrating great teachers. It shows that all is not bad in South African education.\n\nGreat South African Teachers is not about failing schools, troubled children or bad teachers. It is a collection of stories from current and former school children. They celebrate the outstanding South African teachers who transformed their lives. This book tells stories about great educators who come from rich and poor schools, from former-white schools and still-black schools, from the big cities and the small villages.\n\nThey are great in different ways. There are the subject teachers who impress young minds with their teaching skills. There are the teachers experienced in life who help make the connection between classroom learning and preparation for life. There are the extended parents who care not only for the minds of children but for their hearts as well. These are the 'extra-mile' teachers who take on duties of caring beyond their job descriptions. There are courageous stories that tell of teachers who risked their jobs to teach outside the official syllabus during the years of apartheid. Great teachers have one thing in common: they leave a lasting impression on the lives of young people.\n\nThe book started with a simple invitation in The Sunday Times: 'Submit a story about the teacher who made the greatest impact on your life.' Within days, many stories flooded in. It seemed as if people had been waiting for the chance to share their memories of educators who had changed their lives. The book is both challenging and fulfilling.\n\nGreat South African Teachers is challenging because it raises awkward questions. Is it possible that there was a golden era of schooling in South Africa during the apartheid years? Besides the political atmosphere and the restrictions of that time, one gets the distinct idea that many township schools were very productive. Dedicated teachers made sure that children were not disadvantaged in the learning process. The tunnel-view that there were constant pupil uprisings in the past may be misleading. Even in those difficult years, many teachers understood the dangers of 'Liberation now, education later'.\n\nWe have become exhausted by stories of defeat in schools. We are tired of results that show that our children cannot read and write at the expected level. We worry about young people who drop out of school and get into all kinds of trouble. We are concerned about huge government spending on schools for minimal results. This is why the book is fulfilling. It will lift your spirits with the simple message: even though learning material matters, dedicated teachers matter more. As the stories show, teachers are our most important learning resource.\n\nThe book brings back our faith in schooling. It shows that there is hope. This hope is based on good teachers. So this book can show many student teachers which qualities have a positive influence on learning and living. It can inform school governing bodies of the appropriate standards to use when employing teachers. It can enable the government to develop a teacher-education system based on what learners see as important qualities.\n\nGreat South African Teachers will hopefully convey the message that the foundations of democracy and decency are built by dedicated teachers. It is important for the youth to know that teaching is a calling. Many choose it, not because of the material benefits they can obtain, but because of the social benefits that they can give to pupils and society. Many of the great teachers in this book had options but chose teaching because they could make a difference.\n\nThe book celebrates teachers who make the important difference between hope and despair in the lives of 12 million school children in South Africa.\n\n[Adapted from an article by J Jansen, Sunday Times, 9 October, 2011]",

    "passage": "ORGANIC FARMING – WHY THE FUSS?\n\nWe often hear people talk about organic food and see it on shop shelves but many of us do not know exactly what organic food is and why it is so expensive. Is it really better? And is eating organic food a healthier option?\n\nOrganic food is food that has been produced naturally, using only natural substances such as earth and water. No chemical fertilisers or poisons are used and the food is 100% natural.\n\nModern farming involves a lot more than just hoping for rain – it is a science. Thanks to scientific developments during the past decades, farmers can now produce larger quantities of food. They can, for example, feed animals hormones to make them healthier or fatter. On chicken farms, fowls are kept in small enclosures and given special food to make them and their eggs bigger.\n\nCrop farmers can use seed that has been specifically developed to provide large harvests. To prevent their crops from being infected with pests and diseases, crop farmers spray insecticides and other chemicals on the fields.\n\nBut for some time now researchers have been wondering what quantities of these substances land up in our food and how dangerous they are. They started looking at farming methods and soon discovered that these were also harmful to the environment. Good soil contains minerals and very small living creatures among the plants. This is just one of the miracles around us: these small creatures take something from the soil but they also put nutrients back which can in turn be used by something else. This ensures a perfect life cycle in the soil and keeps it healthy and fertile.\n\nWhen the natural cycle of these life forms in the soil is disturbed by the addition of chemical substances, it causes an imbalance. The ground becomes less fertile and requires more chemical fertiliser to make it fertile again. This causes a vicious circle: the more chemicals damage the soil, the more chemicals are needed to supplement it again. This is not ideal as poisons are harmful to the environment.\n\nOrganic farming really means that farmers are returning to the 'good old ways' of doing things. By not using chemicals, organic farmers give the environment a chance to recover naturally and at the same time they are producing food that is free from chemicals.\n\nOrganic farmers use natural methods and work with nature instead of against it. They plant different crops each year so that the nutrients in the soil do not become depleted. Animals, birds and insects are used to control pests. Ladybirds are very popular among organic farmers as they eat the plant lice that damage crops. Natural remedies are used to prevent or treat diseases and animals are allowed to wander and graze freely. Their dung fertilises the soil. Compost is made using animal droppings and plant material which is worked into the soil. Chickens are free-range and can move around scratching for food. A well-functioning organic farm is a natural environment all on its own.\n\nIf it is so simple, why is all food not organically produced? South Africa is still far behind other countries when it comes to organic farming methods. Many South African farmers are hesitant to change their old ways and need to be persuaded to switch to organic farming. There are currently 200 certified organic farms in our country. We do have organisations that control organic farms. They inspect the farms to ensure organic principles are followed.\n\nWhen you buy organic food, make sure it carries a label which reads 'certified organic'. If the label is not there, you may be paying for something which is not what it pretends to be.\n\n[Adapted from YOU, 27 July 2012]",

    "passage": "WINNING WITH WASTE\n\nAccording to the Department of Environmental Affairs, an approximate       \n19 million tons of municipal waste was generated  in South Africa in 2011. \nThis figure must be largely reduced in order to create a healthier \nenvironment. South Africa therefore, aims to have all households in large \nmunicipalities separating their own waste into recyclable and non- recyclable \nmaterial by 2016.  \n\nSeparating recyclables at household level is a requirement in terms of the \nWaste Act. In keeping with this law , the South African government 's \nNational Waste Management Strategy requires that by 2016 all  urban  \nmunicipalities, cities and  towns will have star ted programmes for waste \nseparation in households.  \n\nA survey on recycling in South Africa was carried out by the Council for \nScientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 2010. The survey revealed that \nonly 3, 3% of the country 's urban population regularly recycled household \nwaste. It also revealed an overall negative attitude towards recycling. Urban \nhouseholds are not recycling because of the lack of space and time. \nRecycling is seen as dirty work. In addition, many people do not know what \nis recyclable and what is not.  \n\nA simple solution to motivate South Africans to start recycling in their homes \nis to use the two- bag system. This involves simply separating dry waste, like \npaper, from wet waste, like food scraps, and placing them in separate bags. \nTogeth er with this there must be a regular pavement collection \nservice. CSIR research project leader, Wilma Strydom , said that t he two-\nbag system should be combined with communication and awareness -\nraising campaigns.  \n\nHowever, many individuals and organisations  do show their commitment to \nsaving the plan et through recycling programmes . \n\nIn 2012, Knorr –  a soup manufacturing company –  developed promotional \nmugs that were to be given out with packets of soup. Unfortunately, some of \nthe handles developed cracks. Th e company immediately withdrew the \nmugs so as not to endanger  consumer s. They were then faced with the \nchallenge of what to do with 100 000 useless mugs. Knorr decided to work \nwith USE -IT, an organisation dedicated to recycling waste from landfill or \ndump sites. The two companies developed bricks made of soil and the \ncrushed Knorr mugs. More than 100 000 bricks were manufactured and \ndonated to various charities.   \n\n\nAnother example of an organisation dedicated to recycling is the Wildlands \nConservation Trust whose vision is to make a difference by partnering with \ncommunities and developing unique ways to strengthen our ecosystems. In \n2010, their project began with com munity members collecting waste in and \naround their homes and sorting it into different mediums like glass, cans \nand plastic. The community members are rewarded for their efforts by \nbeing given basic necessities and vouchers.  \n\nWildlands recycled over 4 mil lion kilograms of waste in 2012. Children who \nare part of this project rush home to do their 'jobs' and as a result are \nprevented from getting involved in gang -related or negative activities. \nAccording to the Wildlands Conservation Trust, the changing atti tudes of \ncommunities in relation to waste management have been heart -warming to \nsee. \n\nThe responsibility to reduce waste begins in the household with the \nindividual. Chris Whyte, the managing director of USE -IT, said that his \nfamily of four used to throw away at least two black bags of waste a week. \nThey have now reduced that to one shopping bag per week. He has \nintroduced a system of separating the waste in his home using different \nbins. His family's wet waste, like vegetable peels and chicken bones, goes \ninto composting and fermenting bins. Dry waste, like metal, glass, paper \nand plastic is further separated and put into different bins. These are all \neasy things that his family does and that every family can and should do to \nrecycle waste.  \n\nThe ultimate go al is for all South Africans to see more waste collected and \nrecycled than deposited at landfill sites.  \n\n                            [ Adapted from The Green Lever , Edition 2,  September 2013]",

    "passage": "TEXT A    \n\nNOT SO SWEET , AFTER ALL  \n\n1 The thought of a cupcake, skilfully frosted with fluffy vanilla icing, may put a \nsmile on your face . However, research suggests that – in the long term  – a \nsweet tooth may turn that smile into a frown.  \n\n2 In a new study, published in Scientific Reports , a link has been found \nbetween common mood disorders like depression and a diet high in sugar . \nSugar in its natural form is found in fresh  fruit, vegetables and milk , while \nadded sugars are found in sweet food and beverages, such as cakes and \nsoft drinks. O ther processed foods such as tomato sauce also contain \nadded sugar . Many people consume double and triple the amount of added \nsugar than they should.  The Wo rld Health Organisation recommends that \npeople reduce their intake of added sugar to less than five percent of their \ntotal energy intake.  \n\n3 Could there be a link between high sugar consumption and a person' s \nmood? Research published in 2002 examined the link between depression \nand sugar consumption in six countries. R esearchers from Baylor College \nfound that higher rates of refined sugar intake  are associated with higher \nrates of depression. They found that o ne in six people worldwide suffer from \na common mo od disorder.  \n\n4 In 2011, researchers conducted  a survey on a group of participants who ate \nfactory -baked foods . It was  found that those who ate mostly factory -baked \nfoods had a thirty -eight percent chance of developing depression compared \nwith those in the group with the lowest intake.  \n\n5 A few years later , researchers studied the association between sweetened \nbeverages in a large group of people. They found that sugar -sweetened and \nartificially -sweetened drinks or diet drinks could increase a person' s risk o f \ndeveloping depression. A 2015 study of nearly 70 000 women found that \nthere were higher chances of depression in those people with a high added \nsugar intake.  However,  this was not the case for those people with a high \nintake of naturally occurring sugars , such as those found in fruit.  \n\n6 There is still no absolute certainty about what causes depression, but some \nresearchers believe that biological changes are at the root of this mood \ndisorder. Some of these biological changes could be influenced by sugar \nand a sweet taste. For example, a study in rats found that diets high in \nsugar and fat can reduce a protein that influences the growth and \ndevelopment of nerve cells in the brain. This protein is thought to be \ninvolved in the development of depression and a nxiety. Furthermore, \nanother study using rats suggests sweet foods could be as addictive as \ncocaine. Addiction is, in itself, associated with a higher risk of developing a \nmood disorder.   \n\n7 Ongoing research suggests that mood disorders could be linked with \ninflammation in some cases. High sugar diets can also worsen inflammation which results in low energy levels and a reduc tion in one'\ns ability to \nconcentrat e. This may contribute to feelings of depression.   \n\n8 Finally, sugar intake could be the cause of other health problems, such as \nobesity, which itself is  related to mood. But these associations could also \nreflect a reverse effect : low mood could make people change their diet. \nThey c hoose to consume s weet foods  which soothe negative feelings  in the \nshort -term by providing a mood boost. Low mood and anxiety could make \nsimple tasks, such as grocery shopping or cooking so difficult and \nexhausting for the sufferer that they might start to  avoid them. Instead, they \neat junk food, takeaways and ready meals – all of which have high sugar \ncontent.  \n\n9 Despite these research findings, a number of questions remain about \nwhether sugar  leads to depression , other mood disorders  and illnesses . \nWhat is  certain, though, is that cutting down on sugar is a good idea.                                                         \n\n[Adapted from  Daily News , 24 August 2017 ]",

    "passage": "TEXT A    \n\nTHE PRICE OF HAPPINESS  \n\n1 When one was a child, the promise of money as a reward was both exciting \nand tempting. Being handed a shiny coin or a note for a piggy bank was worth \ntidying up one's room for, even if one did not want to. From a young age, \npeople learn that money offers immediate satisfaction and this feeling never \nstops – even if they do not fully understand why. Author, Claudia Hammond \ndescribes it as a 'magical' experience.  \n\n2 Hammond's book, Mind Over Money: The Psychology of Money and How to \nUse It Better, explores the scientific aspect behind people's relationship with \nmoney and includes 263 different social experiments. These experiments \ninvestigate the way in which money plays psychological tricks and how people \ncan control money, rather than have it control them.  \n\n3 Claudia Hammond claims that money acts like a psychological drug, producing \nsimilar effects to that of dopamine¹ on people's brains. Dopamine is all about \nimmediate reward, rather than delayed satisfaction. It is not specifically the \nlove of money that causes the dopamine effect, but rather what money can \nbuy. It is buying shoes or a car, or whatever else we desire, which gives us  \nthat wonderful feeling.  \n\n4 Cape Town-based financial planner, Charné van der Walt, claims that there is \nnothing wrong with wanting money. She says, 'Having money means that we \nare able to take care of our immediate needs. Not having it can cause anxiety, \nbut if we respect money and are grateful, it will take us further and afford us \nbetter opportunities.' \n\n5 Research shows that only one to three per cent of the population want to make \nmoney in order to grow it. The rest of the population want to make it to spend \nit. It is up to the individuals to make careful decisions regarding how they \nspend and save money. \n\n6 Money can act as both a tool to accomplish the things people want, as well as  \na drug, where people do not use it wisely and instead allow it to control them.  \nIt is also suggested by researchers that buying experiences is better than \nbuying objects. People look forward to experiences much more than they do to \npurchasing new items. After all, new possessions are not new for very long – \nafter a month, a pair of shoes loses its shine. By contrast, pleasurable \nexperiences give people emotional satisfaction and memories which can last a \nlifetime.    \n\n7 Many South Africans also believe in the power of spending on experiences \nand memories, rather than on material things. Experiences with friends and \nfamily can also improve relationships because people engage in an emotional \nway. However, while spending money on experiences is great, it is important \nnot to do so to the point of recklessness or getting into debt.  \n\n8 So, can money buy happiness? Research findings show that some   \nlottery winners still have not found happiness. Two years after their win, most \nof them are actually worse off financially than they were before they won. That \nis because they did not earn the money the hard way, so they do not really \nunderstand the importance of spending it wisely. They spend it on immediate \npleasure and are often overwhelmed by friends or family asking for help. It is \nimportant to invest money and look after it.  \n\n9 However, financial planner, Charné van der Walt, suggests that money can \nbe well spent to bring true fulfilment, happiness and financial freedom. We \nmay earn more, but that does not mean we should spend more. We can find \nreal happiness by spending money on things like education, which could bring \nthe joy of achievement.  \n\n10 It seems that money on its own is not the key to satisfaction. However, using \nit wisely, conserving it for what really matters in people's lives and building \nfinancial security, can be a pathway to a happy life.  \n\n                                                                          [Adapted from  destinyconnect, August   2018]",

    "passage": "TEXT A    \n\nAIDING THE YOUTH BY AIDING THE ELDERLY   \n\n1 Global aging is one of the greatest challenges of the twenty -first century. While  \npolicymakers around the world  are rethinking how society can prepare for an \nincreasing population of elderly people, senior citizens themselves can help \nturn aging from a chal lenge into an opportunity.  \n\n2 Africa 's population is growing fast er than any other continent on E arth. The \nUnited Nations (UN) predicts that  by 2100 , one in four pe ople on the planet will \nlive in Africa . Sub-Saharan Africa ¹ is, by global standards, a region with 60  per \ncent of its population under the age of 25.  \n\n3 Africa's so-called 'youth bulge ' has the potential to contribute to  massive \neconomic growth. One way of creating an  opportunity for the continent 's young \npeople may be, ironically, to look in the oth er direction, to its elderly – and \nparticularly to aging citizens like Novusumzi Masala.  \n\n4 In Novus umzi Masala 's life, there are thirteen of everything – thirteen  pairs of \nbattered  shoes scattered around her tiny two -bedroom house, thirteen  bowls  \nstacked hi gh above her sink, thirteen  stacks of homework to puzzle over every \nnight.  \n\n5 The thirteen  young  lives that orbit around her are not her own children. \nInstead, at age 78, Masala is raising a baker 's dozen of her grandchildren. \n'This isn 't how I pictured my o ld age, ' she says, laughing, as a pair of toddlers \nscurry over her feet. 'But I keep up. This is my family – I could never say no to \nthem. ' \n\n6 'There 's often a perception that older people are vulnerable, frail, and irrelevant \nto what happens to young people , but we know that in reality the lives of older \nand younger people are closely linked – there is a ski lls and knowledge \ntransfer that  needs to happen for society to function, ' says Isabella Aboderin,  \na senior research scientist at the African Population and Health Research \nCentre in Nairobi.   \n\n7 In South Africa, in particular, eight per  cent of all children are being raised by \ntheir grandparents, according to  Statistics South Africa . The United Nations \nInternational Children 's Emergency Fund (UNICEF)  estimates  that half of \nAfrica's 132 million orphans  live with their grandparents.   \n\n8 Grandparents are such an important source of child care and knowledge, that \nsome South African youth centres often offer support for the  elderly. For       \nJoey Manane, who runs a Soweto -based youth organisation called IKUSASA \nLETHU , meaning 'Tomorrow is ours ', the link between old and young is \nessential. He has come to consider providing support to elderly caregivers in \nhis community a ne cessary part of his work to support young people.  \n\n9 Three mornings a week, when the youth finish breakfast and filter out of his \ncentre to head to school, the local grannies begin trickling in, ready for a day \nof crafts, support groups, and sports. 'We have  a very good granny soccer \nteam, ' he says.  \n\n10 'The logic behind having programmes for the elderly at a youth centre is \nsimple, ' he says. 'It makes our work with the youth so much easier if their \n'gogos ' (grannies) feel supported. ' He estimates that about 60 per cent o f the \nyouth he works with  are being raised by grandparents.  \n\n11 At the Masala 's house, a young counsellor from IKUSASA LETHU named \nAngelina Majoro, also drops in once a week to check on Novusumzi and her \ngrandchildren – who range in age from two to seventeen. Sometimes she \nassists with homework, meal preparation,  or family budgeting. Other times, \nshe just sits and listens to the granny 's frustrations about raising thirteen \nchildren when her only source of income is a small grant from the \ngovernment. She wishes they could move into a bigger home. 'It is helpful to \ntalk so I do not bottle things up, ' Masala says.  \n\n12 For the Masalas, however, there is little question of the essential connection \nbetween its younger and older members. On a recent morning, so me of the \nolder children presented their grandmother with a rap song they had written \nabout their lives. 'It's a song about what we have been through and how, with \nthe help of our grandmother, we have made something better from it, ' says \nOngezwa Masala, aged 15.'\n\nGLOSSARY:  Sub-Saharan Africa¹ – African countries that are located south of the \n Sahara Desert",

    "passage": "TEXT A\n\nIT IS IN THE BAG\n\n1 Whether you live on your own or as a family, finding the time and energy to prepare home-cooked meals seems like a daunting task. Over the years, people have thought of different ways to minimise the time they spend cooking in order to have more time with family and friends.\n\n2 The Wonderbag, which was invented in South Africa in 2008, is one product which responded to this need. This product originated from Sarah Collins, an entrepreneur and social activist who had the desire to continue cooking during a national power outage. This award-winning, revolutionary, non-electric, heat-retention cooking bag comes in different sizes. It allows food that has been brought to the boil by conventional methods to continue to cook for up to 12 hours without using additional energy sources.\n\n3 Through the years, the Wonderbag journey has been nothing short of inspiring. It is an innovative solution for Africa's most vulnerable communities and the environment.\n\n4 Cooking with a Wonderbag saves a significant amount of money, water and energy. The environmental benefits that automatically follow are enormous too. Just one Wonderbag used every day reduces up to 1,5 tons of carbon emissions annually. It also reduces exposure to indoor air-pollution by up to 60% in homes. It saves five trees annually from being cut down, therefore limiting deforestation.\n\n5 When you use a Wonderbag, you invest in young people. The number of children, who do at least two hours of household chores per day, almost doubles after they reach the age of 15. By the time they are adults, more than four hours are spent doing household chores every day, leaving precious little time for anything else. Wonderbag cooking saves many hours per year, giving these young adults more time to study. With every year of education, their earning potential is increased, thereby creating a better opportunity for them.\n\n6 The factories and sewing groups that produce Wonderbags provide communities with work they are paid to do. Many people who own a Wonderbag often start their own businesses, such as serving hot food straight out of the Wonderbag at local markets. They are also able to sell other crafts which they now have time to make.\n\n7 The simple act of using a Wonderbag changes people's lives by allowing them control over their finances as they save the money they would have spent paying for charcoal or fuels like gas, paraffin and electricity. Users of the Wonderbag report utilising money saved by cooking in this innovative way to buy more nutritious food and health supplements, such as vitamin tablets for their families. They, therefore, also report fewer health issues.\n\n8 In 2020, over 60 000 Wonderbag non-electric slow cookers were produced as a well-timed response to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Wonderbag partnered with like-minded organisations such as the Community Chest and some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to distribute these bags. Together, they helped families to achieve their potential while simultaneously helping to reduce carbon emissions through more fuel-efficient cooking.\n\n9 'This bag has solved my problems. I can now cook anything I want without fear of burning the food,' reported Evelyn Wani. As a member of a community farming group, she is very happy about this invention. The Wonderbag has been of great help since this group is able to carry their food to the farm land while it is cooking. They would not hesitate to strongly recommend this technology to others. Evelyn also says she used to burn a bundle of firewood for every meal, but now she uses the same bundle for a week or more. Her eye problems have also improved as she uses less wood. Evelyn feels that life is better now because of the Wonderbag.\n\n10 The Wonderbag has made cooking fun and much easier for the whole family. People spend less time cooking and do not have to fight for space and time in the kitchen. They know that once their food is in the bag, they are done with cooking and will have more free time to themselves or to socialise.\n\n[Adapted from wonderbagworld.com]",

    "passage": "GEAR UP FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n\n1 Globally, there are about 10 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the roads  but only 1 509 of them are in South Africa. The South African national target is to have three million electric cars by 2050. According to a recent study, China tops the list of countries with the most registered electric vehicles with more than four million of these cars on its roads. It is followed by the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Norway.\n\n2 Currently, South Africa's 11 million cars fill up at 5 000 petrol stations. Cars are responsible for 10% of the country's carbon emissions and toxic pollutants released in densely populated cities. These emissions and pollutants contribute to air pollution and global warming.\n\n3 Local experts believe that South Africa needs to speed up its move into the electric vehicle industry. This move will benefit the economy, motorists and the environment. With the fuel price constantly rising, the demand for electric cars might very well increase dramatically.\n\n4 The Department of Trade and Industry has drawn up the Strategy for Policy Direction Promoting Green Transport Technologies in South Africa, better known as the green transport strategy. This strategy gives a step-by-step path for the country to follow to get to its target of three million environmentally friendly electric vehicles.\n\n5 The country's vision on climate change says there will be more than three million electric vehicles on the road by 2050, with R6,5 trillion invested in the industry over the next four decades. These two numbers form the basis of the green transport strategy. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, going the electric route will create a huge local industry. Instead of importing fossil fuels1, power for cars will come from solar panels and wind turbines2. The power will be stored in platinum batteries. South Africa has far more platinum than any other country. The demand for platinum will create a mining and manufacturing industry, which will supply more factories that will build electric vehicles.\n\n6 uYilo, an e-mobility programme, was established in 2013 to facilitate electric-vehicle development in South Africa. The name, uYilo, is taken from IsiXhosa, which means 'to create'. The director of this programme, Hiten Parmar, said the government and industry have been having discussions about electric vehicles for quite some time.\n\n7 So far, owners of electric cars in South Africa do not pay fuel tax or contribute to the Road Accident Fund. They also do not pay the taxes levied on normal vehicles for causing air pollution. However, the choice of these vehicles is limited, with only a few models available. The BMW i3, Jaguar I-Pace and the Nissan Leaf top the list. The limited options and the lack of competition contribute to the high price of EVs. With such few buyers of EVs, nobody in the business sector is willing to invest in charging stations. The country only has about 170 electric vehicle charging stations.\n\n8 Since there is limited interest from the business sector to invest in charging stations for EVs, the South African government has set aside an investment of R6,5 trillion. Taken from places such as the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment's Green Fund, this investment will go into improving battery technology so vehicles can go further on a single charge. This will make the building of the electric-vehicle infrastructure more lucrative for the private sector. Eighteen projects have been rolled out already, dedicated to working out the practicalities of electric vehicles. Another twelve projects are working on other green transport technologies, such as upgrading minibus taxis so they also run on natural gas.\n\n9 Toyota is investing millions of rands in electric vehicles globally. The president of Toyota South Motors, Andrew Kirby, believes it will be a while before electric vehicles become commonplace in South Africa. He recommends that the South African government needs to give incentives to encourage the adoption of new energy vehicles as well as make the cost attractive to the local market.\n\n10 Worldwide, the sale of electric vehicles is trending upward. It is estimated that about 50% of new cars sold by 2030 will be electric. The popularity of electric cars will rise as prices come down. Technology is improving as countries invest in battery development. Soon, a plug-in vehicle might be a cheaper and more environmentally friendly option to a fuel-powered car. South Africans should soon be moving in cars that do not harm their health and the environment.\n\n[Adapted from www.mg.co.za, 2022]\n\nGLOSSARY:\n1fossil fuel: a natural fuel such as coal or gas formed from the remains of living organisms\n2wind turbine: a modern windmill for providing electrical power",

    "passage": "WHAT IN THE WORLD IS 'PLOGGING '?\n\nIf you are new to the term 'plogging', sit up and take note. This is the running craze that is sweeping the streets from Sweden through Thailand to London and now, South Africa. This new eco-friendly trend combines physical exercise with its mission to collect litter and help the environment. 'Ploggers' refer to people who clean up litter as they run. Talk about multi-tasking!\n\nThe word plogging is a combination of the English word 'jogging' and the Swedish word 'plocka' which means 'to pick up'. This movement was started in Sweden by trail runner Erik Ahlstrom, who encouraged litter collection while jogging. Environmentally conscious runners have now taken to collecting litter during their runs. Ploggers pull on their disposable gloves, grab a bin bag and scan the streets for litter along their route. Once the bag is full, the litter is deposited in an appropriate recycling bin, thus reducing the amount of litter making its way into the ocean.\n\nPlogging introduces additional movements to exercise that could burn more calories and adds an extra purpose to daily workouts as ploggers are contributing to a really good cause. Those that plogg regularly say it makes them feel even better in many ways. It keeps them motivated mentally and encourages them to add five more minutes of exercise, or plogg an extra kilometre, so they can collect those extra pieces of rubbish. Going an extra mile leaves most ploggers feeling inspired to do more for the environment. Plogging can also be done while walking, cycling or hiking. Basically, it just means combining exercise with picking up rubbish and therefore it is beneficial to all.\n\nPlogging has numerous benefits for both the plogger and the planet. To become a successful plogger, one must have a positive attitude towards trying something new and a willingness to get a bit dirty. Many ploggers like to carry their own reusable garbage bags. Runners should keep in mind that the whole point of plogging is to stay in motion, so they will not be able to pick up every single piece of litter along the route. It is advisable that one gets a plogging buddy who can help collect the pieces left behind.\n\nCommunity members can also get involved by joining a plogging group in their area or even arranging their own plogging challenge. New ploggers can simply get a group of runners together, bring along some rubbish bags and protective gloves and set out on a run. While running, ploggers will sneak in extra exercise by bending down again and again to pick up litter.\n\nIn order to make plogging a trend, ploggers can post about their participation on social media to make it even more fun. They can share ideas and encourage others to start plogging. More than 60 000 photos of runners, who participated in plogging all over the planet, have already been posted on social media. It also does not really matter where they are plogging because 90% of plastic that pollutes the oceans comes from land-based sources. It is therefore important to have plogging clubs in all communities.\n\nWe all have our part to play in reducing pollution. Plogging is a great way to help solve this problem since it is a free and easy way to train while giving runners an opportunity to take care of the environment. The responsibility to save the planet by making it cleaner and healthier does not only lie with the environmentalists. We should always remember that if all hands are on deck, the load always feels lighter.\n\n[Adapted from My Virtual Challenge Magazine, 2022]",

    "passage": "International Nurses' Day is celebrated every year on 12 May, the anniversary of Florence Nightingale's birth. But who was this extraordinary woman?\n\nFlorence Nightingale (12 May 1820 – 13 August 1910) showed great courage and determination by following her calling to improve public health despite the disapproval of family and society.\n\nWhen the Crimean War broke out in 1854, she oversaw the introduction of female nurses into the military hospitals in Turkey. Initially greeted with hostility, she took quick action to improve the dreadful conditions under which the wounded were treated, dramatically reducing mortality rates among soldiers from 40% to 2%.\n\nThough she returned to England as a national heroine, she deliberately hid from public life. She worked non-stop and her first major works were two books published in 1859, Notes on Hospitals and Notes on Nursing. She also published over 200 reports and pamphlets on a wide range of issues including hygiene, hospital administration and design, delivery of babies and health care for the poor.\n\nShe founded the Nightingale School and Home for Nurses at St. Thomas's Hospital, London, in 1860 – the first of its kind. The objective of the school was to produce nurses who could train others. The following year she established a training school for midwives in King's College hospital.\n\nDespite her poor health, Florence Nightingale worked tirelessly until her death at the age of 90. She personified many of the important ideas that are crucial to nursing today – values, vision and voice. She saw nursing as helping people to live and promoted the importance of the nurse's integrity. Florence Nightingale fought for health care for people regardless of faith or economic background. She understood the valuable contribution nurses could make to personalised health care and believed it was important to look after both the mental and the physical health of the individual. Florence Nightingale advocated trained nursing and preventive health care through proper hygiene. Through her contacts in the government, she influenced public policy and achieved positive health care reforms.\n\n[Adapted from an article in Pretoria News, 12 May 2009]",

    "passage": "TEXT A\n\n5       BABY FAT \n\nChildhood obesity has been described as one of the most serious public \nhealth challenges of the 21st century. \n\n'It is just puppy fat – she will grow out of it.' 'Children need to eat as much as \npossible to grow.' 'The extra kilos only mean he has a healthy appetite.' These \ncommon misunderstandings about children who are overweight or obese just \ndo not hold true anymore. In fact, the World Health Organisation, which \nmonitors health matters worldwide, describes childhood obesity as one of the \nmost serious public health challenges of the 21st century. \n Globally, in 2007, an estimated 22 million children under the age of five years \nwere overweight. In South Africa, 17% of children between one and nine \nyears are overweight. For these children, the risk of becoming overweight \nadults and catching various illnesses increases in a big way. In addition, \noverweight or obese children may struggle with emotional issues like \ndiscrimination and poor self-image, even when they are adults.  \n In some cases, what children inherit from their parents can be blamed for \nweight gain. However, lifestyle issues most often play a role in children \nbecoming overweight, especially in recent times. According to the World \nHealth Organisation, one of the main reasons for childhood obesity is the \nsteady global shift in diet towards energy-dense foods which are high in fat \nand sugar but low in nutrients.  Another reason for weight gain is decreased physical activity levels. The \nWorld Health Organisation mentions that this is the result of 'the inactive \nnature of many forms of entertainment, changing forms of transport, and \nincreasing urbanisation'. In South Africa, safety concerns can be added to this \nlist. Fearing for their children's safety, parents may refuse to let them ride their \nbicycles or walk to school. \n Parents need to manage their children's weight: while inherited causes need to be managed medically, lifestyle factors can be changed or improved. 'The \nsooner you start, the better,' says Brad Bing, the driving force behind Sporting \nChance which is a youth sports development agency. He says, 'Research \nshows that children begin their lifestyle patterns by the age of 12. Therefore, it \nis important that children eat healthily and lead an active lifestyle as early as \npossible in order to adopt these practices later in life.'    \n 'Parents need to set a good example by eating the same healthy dishes as \ntheir children and also sharing meal times with them. They should aim to \nencourage healthy eating patterns and build a ''healthful'' relationship with \nfood in their children,' says Celeste Naudé, a registered dietician. 'Research \nhas shown that starting with healthier eating habits could provide life-long \nbenefits.'  Greasy fast food, unhealthy pre-packaged meals and sugar-laden tuck-shop \ntreats have become a habit with most children. These eating habits contribute \nto children becoming overweight. 'Childhood is an intensive growth and \ndevelopment phase. That's why children need more nutritious food. To \nprovide all the essential nutrients, a child's meals and snacks should include a \nwide variety of foods from each group, in amounts suited to the child's \nnutritional needs and appetite,' advises Celeste. We live in a society where \neverything needs to be bigger and better, and that also applies to our meals. \nCeleste says meal serving sizes should increase with age. However, it is \nimportant that children are guided and taught about suitable meal portion \nsizes early.  The World Health Organisation suggests that parents make physical activity \npart of the family's daily routine. Parents should make time for family walks or \nplaying active games together. In addition to increasing their physical activity, \nchildren should decrease the amount of time they spend on inactive activities \nlike playing computer games and watching television. 'Children should be \nencouraged to participate in an organised sport that they may enjoy. Not only \nwill they become physically active, but also gain confidence and essential life \nskills.'  The approach to weight problems in children is important and should be done \nin a way that the child is not made to feel victimised or different. When it \ncomes to children and obesity, it helps to remember that every action taken to \nprevent weight gain will pay off in the long run.  \n[Adapted from Oxygen, Autumn 2009]",

    "passage": "PHELOPHEPA − SOUTH AFRICA 'S TRAIN OF HOPE  \n\n1 In the rural communities of countries with limited resources, health  care \nclinics are often scarce. Many people have to travel long distances to \naccess even the most basic health care for themselves and their families.  \n\n2 Transnet Limited, South Africa' s biggest state -owned freight transportation \nand logist ics company, saw the need to provide access to basic health care \nservices. In 1993, they provided three coaches to be used as a clinic that \ntravelled across the country offering only eye care to rural communities. On \none of her trips on the \" Eye Train \", Dr Lynette Coetzee, head of Transnet 's \nSocial Corporate Investment Department, saw more than 2 000 people \nwaiting for hours to receive glasses. She then decided t hat what was \nneeded was a fully -fledged hospital train and convinced her boss to invest \nmillions  in the Phelophepa project.  \n\n3 The name Phelophepa is derived from Sesotho an d Setswana meaning \n'good, clean health'.  It began operating as a full -scale mobile primary health  \ncare clinic in 1994. Phelophepa is owned and operated by Transnet and \nbrings together many diverse stakeholders from the private and public \nsectors.  \n\n4 One of its kind in the world, the Phelophepa Hospital train has 18 coaches \nand a dedicated staff of passionate professionals. The health  care staff \nincludes close to 40 student volunt eers preparing for careers in a variety of \nhealth- related fields. For two decades n ow, the train has helped over        \n5,5 million people.  \n\n5 Phelophepa provides facilities to conduct general health, dental and eye \nchecks and to dispense medicines for diagn osed conditions. In addition to \nthese essential health services, individual counselling sessions and group \nworkshops are offered. These workshops help people to cope with mental  \nissues such as stress and depression.  \n\n6 South Africa's second state -of-the-art clinic on wheels, Phelophepa II, hit \nthe tracks  in 2012, equipped with the latest medical and information \ntechnology. The second train operates simultaneously with Phelophepa I. \nWith the introduction of Phelophepa II, Transnet has more than doubled the \nnumber of people who benefit from the facility. An estimated 375 000 \npeople now receive vital health care annually.   \n\n7 The trains currently travel 38 weeks a year and are only able to visit most of \nthe communities on their rout e once. It is therefore important  that the \npositive effects of the trains last for much longer than the week for which \nthey stop at each station. As a result, there is a strong emphasis on \neducation and empowerment in all of Phelophepa' s activities.  \n\n8 Phelophepa I and II are giving more people an opportunity to live healthy, \nquality lives. Whole communities welcome the train as though it is an old, \nfamiliar and trusted family friend.  Every year the Phe lophepa eye clinic \ndispenses thousands of pairs of glasses to adults and children at a nominal \ncost.  \n\n9 Dr Lynette Coetzee remembers when an 87- year-old grandmother from \nKwaZulu- Natal visited the mobile clinic. The grandmother was hoping to \nreceive a pair of  glasses so she could see the letters in her Bible, even \nthough she was unable to read. Her eyes were tested, the glasses were \nmade, and a young optometry student fitted them carefully on her face. 'You \nlook beautif ul in these, ' he told the grandmother. Sh e sat in silence for a \nwhile, and then she started crying. The student was worried that there was \nsomething wrong with the glasses, but the woman was only crying because \nshe was happy. She was able to see the world clearly for the first time         \nin years.  \n\n10 As a driving force of Phelophepa, Dr Lynette Coetzee says, ' The health \nservices that we offer on board the train are only part of the story. The \nbroader mission of Phelophepa is that its message and its good work will \ncontinue, that healthy individuals will build healthy families and \ncommunities, and that healthy communities will build a healthy nation.

    "passage": "ALONE TOGETHER\n\nWe live in a technological universe in which we are always communicating.\nYet while we might feel more connected to one another, we have lost the\nability to create meaningful relationships. The digital age has already\nchanged the way we shop, work, play and communicate. We live in a world\nwhere normal conversations have been replaced by online communication.\nAt home, families sit together, texting and reading e- mail. At work,\nexecutives text during board meetings. We text and go on Facebook during classes and when we are on dates.\n\nPeople have sacrificed conversation for mere connection in their plugged- in\nlives. The little devices that most of us carry around are so powerful that\nthey change not only what we do,  but also who we are. We have become\naccustomed to a new way of being ' alone together '.\n\nYoung people have grown up fearing conversation. They walk around with\nearphones, creating a barrier between themselves and the world. We are\ntogether but each of us is in our own bubble, furio usly connected to\nkeyboards and touch screens.\n\nIn the silence of connection we are comforted by being in touch with a lot of\npeople. However, they are carefully kept at bay: not too close, not too far,\njust right. We have become used to being in a tribe o f one.\nA 16 -year-old boy , who relies on texting for almost everything , says sadly,\n'Someday, someday, but certainly not now, I 'd like to learn how to have a\nconversation. '\n\nTechnology lets us present the self we want to be. The way we\ncommunicate is maki ng us worse people to be around. A recent report\nfound that 51% of adults and 65% of teenagers say they have used their\nsmartphones while socialising. We are creating an environment where eye\ncontact, body language and physical contact are declining. Researchers\ndiscovered students prefer to text a classmate rather than talk in person\nbecause it 's 'less risky ' and 'less awkward' . So they don' t learn how to read\nfacial expressions or navigate 'real world ' social situations.\n\nHuman relationships are complex but we have learned to simplify them with\ntechnology. The move from conversation to connection is part of this. We\nexpect more from technology and less from one anothe r and seem\nincreasingly drawn to technologies that provide an illusion of companionship\nwithout the demands of a relationship. Over time we forget that there is a\ndifference. We are tempted to think that our little sips of online connection\nadd up to a big  gulp of real conversation. But they do not. Social networks\nhave their places and no matter how valuable, they do not substitute for\nconversation. They do not work as well when it comes to understanding and\nknowing one another.\n\nWhen we communicate on ou r digital gadgets, we learn different habits.\nWhen people are alone, even for a few minutes, they reach for a device.\nThese devices provide three powerful fantasies: that we will always be\nheard; that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; and  that we\nnever have to be alone. We think that constant connection will make us feel\nless lonely. The opposite is true.\n\nYoung people today have skills the previous generations lacked. They are\nexperts at finding and filtering information, responding to s timuli and doing\nfast, insightful analysis. As 'digital natives' they are used to technological\nchange but lack the skill of face- to-face conversation. To make room for real\nconversation, deliberate steps must be taken by parents in the home. The\nvalue of conversation must be demonstrated to children. Certain areas in the\nhome like the kitchen or dining room must be made 'device- free zones',\nsacred spaces where family members engage in conversation. We should\nnot be so busy connecting that we do not talk to one another about what\nreally matters.\n\nMost of all we need to remember – in-between social networking –  to listen\nto one another, even to the boring bits, because it is in the unedited\nmoments of human contact that we really reveal ourselves to one anoth er.\n\n[Adapted from Sunday Magazine in Sunday Tribune, 22 June 2014]",

    "passage": "TEXT A\n\nWITH A PINCH OF SALT\n\n1 South Africans just love fast foods. Many believe that there is nothing wrong\n2 with fast foods and that too much of a fuss is made about nutrition.\n\n3 A study by Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) Surveys shows that half of South\n4 Africans treat their health casually and that 62% are not interested in health\n5 or nutrition issues. South Africans would rather buy fast foods than cook\n6 fresh meals.\n\n7 Fast foods are generally processed and have a high salt content. A recent\n8 international survey by World Action on Salt and Health (WASH) was\n9 conducted on leading fast food outlets. The findings suggest that children\n10 could at times be consuming three times more salt in fast foods than is\n11 actually required.\n\n12 Salt is regarded as the main factor contributing to high blood pressure,\n13 strokes, heart attacks and kidney failure. The survey by WASH, which\n14 analysed salt content in children's meals in 37 countries, has ranked South\n15 Africa among the top ten nations for having the saltiest children's fast food\n16 meals.\n\n17 Popular franchises like KFC, McDonald's, Burger King and Subway were\n18 among those surveyed. Conducted in partnership with the Heart and Stroke\n19 Foundation of South Africa, the survey found South Africa's KFC chicken\n20 burger and chips to be the saltiest globally, with a salt content of\n21 2,91 grams. This is more than half a teaspoon per meal, and about three\n22 times more than the one gram of salt recommended for each meal. South\n23 African McDonald's chicken nugget meal also had a high amount of salt,\n24 with 1,67 grams. This was ranked the third saltiest chicken nugget meal in\n25 the world after Turkey and Venezuela.\n\n26 In addition, the survey showed that the salt content in fast foods varied\n27 significantly from country to country. Legislation on salt content was\n28 introduced earlier in some countries. The United Kingdom (UK) and the\n29 United States of America (USA) consistently had low salt content in most of\n30 their children's meals, less than one gram. The McDonald's chicken nugget\n31 meal in the UK had the lowest salt content at 0,78 grams.\n\n32 The above study has raised concern, prompting the South African Health\n33 Department to call for the country's fast food outlets to reduce their salt\n34 content in food. Regulations that were recently introduced in South Africa\n35 would hopefully reduce the amount of salt in fast foods. It is important that\n36 the fast food outlets take a lead in reducing the amount of salt used during\n37 food preparation.\n\n38 Christelle Crickmore from the Heart and Stroke Foundation, who helped to\n39 collect data from fast food outlets in South Africa, also raised concerns\n40 about the amount of salt in the country's fast foods. 'With South Africans\n41 having one of the highest rates of high blood pressure worldwide – and with\n42 one in ten children suffering from the disease – we simply cannot afford to\n43 allow such high levels of salt in popular children's meals,' she said.\n\n44 What is also cause for concern is the fact that 63% of parents admit that\n45 they have problems convincing their children to eat healthily. Most children\n46 choose food on taste, rather than on its perceived healthiness, and think\n47 healthy food does not taste good.\n\n48 Salt Watch, a non-governmental organisation, was launched to educate\n49 South Africans on healthy foods and on the dangers of high salt\n50 consumption. The group will complement the work done at government\n51 level. The South African Department of Health has been supportive of salt\n52 reduction campaigns for some time, stating in Parliament that the diet of\n53 South Africans has been shown to be very high in salt. Legislation was\n54 recently signed to make salt reduction in the food industry mandatory over a\n55 period of time.\n\n56 Legislation alone is not going to lower salt consumption in South Africa and\n57 improve health. It will have to be a collaborative effort of government, the\n58 food industry and organisations such as the Heart and Stroke Foundation.\n59 The people of South Africa also have a role to play. They have to start\n60 choosing products with a lower salt content and use less salt at the table\n61 and when cooking. Children need to be taught to eat healthily from an early\n62 age.\n\n[Adapted from Daily News, 20 August 2015 and saltwatch.co.za]",

However, what is a generation? There are no precise \ndates when a generation starts or ends but researchers have come up with \nestimat ed dates. Dr Jean Twenge, the author of Generation Me , defines a \ngeneration as people born arou nd the same time who are shaped  by social \nevents that occur during that period . While these individuals share historical \nand cultural environments, they also shape culture in their own way.  \n \nThe generation that grew up during the Great Depression and World War II \nwas known as the Traditionalists . Some famous faces of this generation  \nare Martin Luth er King, Marilyn Monroe, Muhamma d Ali and Miriam Makeba.  \nThe hard ships of this era encouraged teamwork in order to overcome \nchallenges and make progress.  \n \nFrom 1946 to 1964 there was an increase in the post -World War II birth rate. \nThose born during this period became known as the Baby Boomers. Michael \nJackson, Steve B iko, Brenda Fassie and Barack Obama belong to this \ngeneration, also known as the Rock ' n Roll generation. It was during this era \nthat television was first introduced to certain parts of the world.  \n \nThen came Generation X from 1965 to 1976. This short perio d gave rise to  \na career -driven and street -smart group like Charlize Theron, Somizi Mhlongo \nand Jay -Z.  \n \nThey were followed by Generation Y or the M illennials. Mark Zuckerberg, \nBeyonce, Bonang Matheba and Chad l e Clos characterise the spirit of this \ngeneration. Millennials were born between 1980 and 1994 and grew up in  \na time of self -focus and  optimism.  \n \nThe generation after the M illennials, born between 1995 and 2012, were  \nthe first generation to grow up with smartphones. They are known as  \nGeneration Z,  Gen Z, or iGen. This generation is also called Centennials  \nbecause they are the first generation of the new century .  \n \nDr Sethulego Matebesi, head of the Sociology Department at the University of \nthe Free State, says: ' They are the * hashtag generation and  in South Africa \nwe also call them the Born Frees.'  They were born after 1994 and the notion \nof this generation is that they have a global view of life.   \n   \n 5 \n     \n10 \n     \n15 \n     \n20 \n      \n25 \n     \n30 \n  \n \n8 \n \n  \n \n9 \n    \n \n10 \n  \n \n11 \n      \n \n12 \n    \n \n13 \n   \n \n14 \n  \n \n15 Matebesi says that the key difference between Generation  Y and Generation  Z \nis their interaction with technology. While Generation Y interacted with \ntechnology later in their lives, Generation Z has been immersed in it right from \nthe start.  \n \nMillenn ials could talk to their parents or friends about anything, but \nCentennials do not. They believe that everything they need to know is \navailable online.

    "passage": "TEXT A    \n\nSOLE -SEARCHING  \n Sneakers are casual shoes also known as ' takkies' . Today, t hese shoes are a  \npopular choice of footwear worn by all types of people throughout the world.   \nThe first sneaker was introduced in the 1860s in the form of a specialised \nrunning shoe made of leather and spikes. By 1892 the United States Rubber \nCompany modified the design to include a rubber sole.  These shoes were \nmass- produced and nicknamed ' sneakers ', because of  their soft, noiseless \nrubber sole s.  \n \nToday, the sneaker culture is worth billions of rands  worldwide. The market \ncontinues to grow rapidly. A 2017 report released by Transparency Market \nResearch expects the global footwear market to reach  over 3 trillion rands in \nvalue by 2020. It is i mpossible to deny that what was once street culture has \nturned into a mass consumer movement.  \n \nThe market is driven by people known as sneakerheads, who collect,  trade or \nadmire sneakers as a hobby. It is also promoted by hip- hop culture and \nordinary peop le who love this type of footwear. The sneaker culture has risen \nfrom humble, functional beginnings to the fashion trend it is today.  \n \nConverse,  a sneaker manufacturer, was the first company to get celebrities to \nendorse their products. They set a marketi ng standard in the world of athletic \nfootwear by adding the name of celebrity basketball player, Chuck Taylor , to \nthe ankle patch of their All Star sneakers.  \n \nWhat began as a subculture is now universal and the sneaker industry 's \ngrowth can be plotted alongside the rise of a music culture from the 1950s , \nwhen famous musicians wore this type of footwear. It exploded with the \ncommercialisation of hip- hop. A turning point was the release of rapper     \nRUN- DMC 's track,  My Adidas. This signified the beginning  of sneaker \nendorsement ¹ deals for non- athletes and what rappers wore started to \nbecome popular among the youth.  \n \n'From a young age it has always been about having the coolest sneaker but \nnow it is also about the culture, ' explained  Thabo and Thabiso Modi selle, \nfounders of culture and sneaker site, YoMzansi. 'We were influenced by \nstreetwear, music and hip- hop movies, and started studying the culture and \neducating ourselves on major sneaker brands. '  \n \nSneaker culture continues to be influenced by basketball and hip -hop music \nwith no signs of slowing down. Teenagers look up to a lot of musicians who \ncan be seen on television wearing these brands. Most teenagers wear what \nthey see on television. They will buy a pair of sneakers because they saw one \nof their favourite artists post it on social media, or wearing them in a new music \nvideo.  \n \nAs streetwear devotee,  Naledi Radebe , puts it, 'At the most basic level, \nsneakers are a form of transport. At the highest, they are a symbol of character \nand status. All these shoes say something about the people who own them.  \nThey are a representation of the energy and spirit you, as an individual, want to \nsend to the world.'  \n \nSneaker bra nds have changed their business model only a decade ago and \nnow rely on the internet to promote their products. One can always find out \nabout fresh trends on Instagram or use specific websites to order directly. \nTechnology has made it infinitely quicker to share sneaker information and to \nsell them across the globe.  \n \nThe online shopping for sneakers has been made easy. Some people still \nenjoy the culture of walking into the store and trying on a pair of sneakers. \nHowever, others are moving towards online sh opping because of the wide \nrange available, regardless of where they are in the world.  \n \nThe sneaker culture is serious business. Today sneakers go way beyond \nfashion or functionality; they signify who you are through the choices you \nmake.  \n \nSneakers have t he unique power to transcend boundaries of gender, age and \nsocio -economic standing, positioning them as the footwear of choice for \nmillions of people.  \n \n   [Adapted from Sunday Tribune, 24 September 2017]   \n\n Glossary:  \nendorsement ¹: showing one' s public  approval or support of a product or a brand.",

    "passage": "TEXT A    \n\nGET CREATIVE, GET BETTER  \n\n1 We undertake creative activities such as drawing, painting , writing, acting or  \ndancing because we enjoy them. We know that creativity is good for us and \nour creative passions make us happy. However,  what do scientists have to say \nabout the benefits of creativity?  \n\n2 Some people pursue creative activities as a hobby and some do it for a living. \nHowever, no matter what road we have taken to release  our imagination  and \nneed for free self -expression, it is clear that making things is part of being \nhuman.  \n\n3 People have been c reative since prehistoric times. More than 39  900 years \nago our ancestors left some of their first marks  on the walls of caves. These \ninclude  the outlines of their hands and simple drawings of an imals. We could \ngo as far as to say that our need t o create things is in our blood. T his has \nserved us well over the course of time, as we have learned to create tools, \nbuild shelters, cook food and make medicines.  \n\n4 Drawing, painting or shaping  objects fr om clay has been scientifically proven to \nhelp people deal with different kinds of trauma. 'Art helps people express \nexperiences that are too difficult to put into word s,' say Heather L Stuckey and \nJeremy Nobel  in an article  entitled , 'The Connection Betwe en Art, Healing and \nPublic Health '. This article further states, 'Artistic self -expression might \ncontribute to  our mental well -being .' \n\n5 A number of studies have also found that expressive writing  can help people to \novercome trauma and manage negative emoti ons. This type of writing allows \npeople to come to terms with  negative situations that cannot be changed . \nExpressing one 's feelings through writing creates emotional healing for events \nthat have left permanent  scars  – such as serious illness, the death of a loved \none or a violent experience.  \n\n6 Expressive writing does not just help with trauma and negative emotions , but \ncan also lead to an increased sense of psychological well-being. This can be \nachieved by a sking people to write about positive experiences a nd about being \nthe person  they want to be in the future.  \n\n7 Research has also shown that writing can help with learning and \nmemorisation. However, you cannot take a shortcut and type the ideas you \nwant to remember, as this would not help you. Researchers say  that you have \nto be old -fashioned and put pen to paper.   \n\n8 One of the findings of a study carried out by Stuckey and Nobel is that w riting \nalso helps with chronic pain mana gement. People who had experience d such \npain had improved pain control after expressing their feelings in writ ing.  \n\n9 Another form of therapy is music. Music affects our brain in complex ways, \nstimulating the body and controlling  our response to stressful f actors or \nsituations. Making music can have a significant impact on how well different \nareas of our brain communicate with each other. According to Stuckey and \nNobel, playing a musical instrument, singing or listening to music can improve \nyour immune syste m.  \n\n10 Creative expression through movement brings its own set of benefits  to one 's \nwell-being . Dancing helps  to improve shoulder function in breast cancer \nsurvivors and it has  a positive impact on their body image. Moreover, dancing \ncan be a fun way of  staying or becoming fit. Recent studies have shown that \nZumba , an intense dance -exercise programme, can improve blood pressure, \nwhile previous studies linked aerobic dance to better weight management.   \nHip hop and aerobic dancing can improve psychological mood s and  they can \nalso lower levels of fatigue.   \n\n11 It is evident that being creative bring s order to our mental and physical states, \nbenefit ting our overall well -being. Why not take advantage of this and welcome  \nmore creativity into our lives?   \n\n                                                                [Adapted from  www.medicaln ewstoday .com , 2018 ]",

    "passage": "MANNERS MATTER\n\nThe Collins Dictionary defines 'Etiquette '* as: 'The customs or  rules governing  behaviour  regarded as correct or acceptable in social or official life '. This is related to how people behave in a p articular group  or in a specific setting .  \n\nWhen you show consideration for others, you display good  manners .                         For example, speaking to other people  sitting at  the dinner table  at a party  is good manners. Writing a message or e-mail to the hosts of the dinner party the next day , expressing your gratitude for being invited , is polite . This would most likely lead to you being invited to their next dinner party.  \n\nGood  manners have their origins in ancient history. For instance, it may be seen as hygienic to co ver your mouth when yawning. However, centuries ago the act of yawn ing was believed  to be the soul leaving one 's body, allowing evil spirits to enter. The belief was that covering the mouth kept the soul inside  the body . The habit of s aying 'Bless you' when someone sneezes dates ba ck to the time of Pope Gregory the First . He commanded that anyone who sneezed should be blessed in case they had contracted the plague, which was a deadly disease at that time.  \n\nManners are often  used as a means to judge people.  For example, in Western culture, one is judged by the way one uses one 's cutlery at the dinner table. However, there are some cultures that use their hands to eat their food.  \n\nIn most African culture s, a child is expected to address adults with a  certain  level of formality, regardless of their relationship with them. Not using a title when addressing adults is co nsidered to be highly insulting , yet in some cultures it is acceptable to address an adult by his or her first name. It is also a sign of respect  not to look an elder in the eye but this may not necessarily be so in other cultures.  \n\nIn Kenya and Nigeria,  when greeting a person, it is the  norm to ask about their general well -being. Skipping this part is considered very poor manners.                      In some cultures, presenting a gift  to someone should be done with the right hand or both  hands , but never with the left hand alone. T he question is, whose manners are correct ?  \n\nIn a multicultural society like South Africa, the question of etiquette can be challenging when trying to understand one another. Therefore, with the many distinct cultural groups that make up this nation, the entire point of etiquette is to promote smooth social relations. If used correctly, manners can unite people rather than cause conflict. This can be achieved if South Africans are willing to  understand or learn about the behaviour of the many groups of people who live in this country. If  not used correctly, different understandings of etiquette across cultures can affect everything from your relationship with others to your ability to get a job.  \n\nResearch by a communication company, Commiceo, has found that there can be discrimination at job interviews due to differences in etiquette. The company noted how things such as eye contact or mentioning the names of important people during the interview, can be interpreted very differently.                       It further reports that while many  cultures in Europe, North America and Asia emphasise the importance of punctuality, many other cultures do not engage in the same type of clock -watching.  \n\nTo speak loudly and clearly may be viewed as a positive quality and n ot a sign of disrespect in the  Western world. However, in many other countries , like Malaysia, people believe that speaking softly is a good quality. Therefore, instead of judging someone because they do something in a certain way, it is important to understand the reasons for their be haviour and actions.  \n\nWe must remember that our ancestors developed etiquette over the years to foster social harmony and keep conflict at a minimum.  \n\n[Adapted from Sunday Times , Lifestyle , 27Ja nuary 2019]",

    "passage": "TEXT A\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5 RETHINKING GARBAGE\n\nThe medals of the Olympic Games were previously made from gold, silver and\nbronze obtained from the mines. They are now being made of 100% recycled\ne-waste ¹. You may be amazed to know that the new Olympic medals are made\nfrom precious metals recycled from old cellphones. This e-waste may\notherwise have clogged up landfill² sites. Similarly, you may not realise that\nyour paper towels are actually recycled office documents and cereal boxes, or\nthat the walkways along some of South Africa's beaches are made of plastic\nbottle tops.\n\nRecycling has become a way of reducing the growing 'mountains' of waste in\nthe world. The recycling of suitable materials and the separation of waste into\ncategories will not only relieve pressure on the planet, but also create\nemployment and boost the economy. In South Africa, 108 million tonnes of\nwaste are generated every year, with 90% of this (about R17 billion worth of\nresources) discarded on landfill sites. Kate Stubbs is the Director of Business\nDevelopment and Marketing at the recycling company, Interwaste. She says\nthat Johannesburg's landfill sites will run out of space in ten years and that\nSouth Africa is still far behind other countries when it comes to recycling.\n\n'Every single bit of waste presents an opportunity – it is about finding\nsustainable solutions no matter what the kind of waste, industry or potential\nchallenges are,' says Stubbs. 'For example, the urge to stop waste from being\ndumped at landfill sites has directly resulted in companies focusing on reusing\nand recycling. In order to reduce the amount of waste, manufacturers are\nrethinking the type of resources that they should use to make their goods of\ntoday, which will become the raw materials of tomorrow.'\n\nKate Stubbs adds that the conversion of waste to energy addresses two\nimportant sustainability challenges in Africa: power generation, and reducing\nreliance on landfills. In 2016, Interwaste started a project to make fuel from\nwaste, the first of its kind in South Africa. This fuel is the same as high quality\ncoal. It forms a sustainable alternative to coal which is commonly used in the\ngeneration of power.\n\nAnother company, Mpact, Southern Africa's largest paper and plastics\npackaging and recycling business, recovered more than 630 000 tonnes of\nrecyclable waste in 2018. 'With the recycling industry already providing jobs for\n100 000 South Africans, it is clearly a growth industry,' says Mpact Chief\nExecutive Officer, Bruce Strong. Mpact supports recycling ventures that range\nfrom informal waste collectors with shopping trolleys, small business owners\nwho transport waste in their trucks and those that manage waste collection\ncentres.\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nBruce Strong said that Mpact has recently changed their approach to\npackaging by offering customers practical alternatives to non-recyclable\nproducts. Mpact has replaced the non-recyclable packaging of fast-food\ncompany, Fishaways, with a cardboard box that is fully recyclable and lower in\ncost. It has also supplied Steers with equally sustainable cardboard packaging\nfor its burger meal.\n\nIn Cape Town, a company called NewLife Plastics is giving about 120 000\nplastic packaging containers per month a new lease on life in the form of\ngarden benches, plastic tables and walkways. 'We use polyolefin, a type of\nhigh-density plastic found in milk bottles, bottle caps and heavier plastic bags,'\nsays company co-founder Bronwyn Bagley. The garden furniture is made from\nplanks that look like wood but are practically indestructible. 'They do not\nrequire any maintenance and will not rot, crack, bend, fade in the sun or\nbecome slippery when wet,' says Bagley. 'As an added benefit, public benches\nor walkways made from recycled packaging generally do not get vandalised or\nstolen, because the material is extremely heavy, does not burn and has no\ncommercial resale value.'\n\nThe need for a culture change and shift towards saving our planet, like\nInterwaste, Mpact and NewLife Plastics are doing, is necessary to avoid\npotential crises and ensure a sustainable future in Africa. Their efforts could be\nthe start of a garbage revolution that will help save our planet.\n\n[Adapted from Equinox, November–December 2019]\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n\nGLOSSARY\ne-waste ¹ – discarded electronic equipment\nlandfill² – a site for the dumping of waste material",

    "passage": "MOVING TOWARDS THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\nThe Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is also referred to as 4IR and Industry 4.0, is paving the way for major changes in the way we live. This latest revolution may be described as the blurring of boundaries between the physical (what we see and hear), digital (the internet, cellular phones and other technological devices) and the natural worlds. It is the collective force behind many products and services that are fast becoming essential to our modern life. \nWhere did the term 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' come from? The Fourth Industrial Revolution builds on foundations laid by the first three industrial revolutions. In the 18th century, the First Industrial Revolution took place when the steam engine for trains was invented, factories started producing goods on a large scale and people moved to the cities. \nIn the Second Industrial Revolution, electricity and other scientific inventions led to mass production. The Third Industrial Revolution, which began in the 1950s, saw the emergence of computers and digital technology. This led to a different way of working or manufacturing in industries as well as in banking and communications. \nKlaus Schwab, author of the book The Fourth Industrial Revolution, wrote that 'like the revolutions that preceded it, the Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to raise global income levels and improve the quality of life for populations around the world'. \nOne of the changes that the Fourth Industrial Revolution has introduced is artificial intelligence. Computers have started to 'think' like humans and have become smarter. The internet plays a key role in the latest industrial revolution because devices such as the cellular phone can be linked to various online applications. There is an application that monitors your health and instantly informs you if you are ill. It is also possible to use your cellular phone to translate any menu, poster or text from another language into the language that you understand, or to find the shortest route to travel anywhere. In the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the use of robotics means that technology has advanced in such a way that robots could be used in factories, offices and homes to solve problems. Farmers would also be able to place devices in the soil to tell them when their crops need to be watered or fertilised. \nAll these technological innovations also mean that businesses can no longer do business in old-fashioned ways. They must prepare their employees for the new world that lies ahead. This often means an increased focus on continual learning and upskilling to new types of jobs. Furthermore, businesses must focus more than ever on delivering a customer experience that keeps the customer smiling. Research shows that 57% of customers have stopped buying from some businesses because another business has provided a better or more modern service. \nThe major impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution will soon be felt in the workplace. As with previous industrial revolutions, the Fourth Industrial Revolution could profoundly1 affect people's lives because it is believed that robots would cause many types of jobs to disappear. Klaus Schwab has also suggested that this revolution could lead to greater inequality as the job market may become segregated2 into 'low-skill/low-pay' and 'high-skill/high-pay' roles which could lead to conflict in society. \nThe positive side is that new categories of jobs are emerging. It is important that we continue learning new skills for new jobs. In the fourth industrial world, we need to be adaptable3, creative and able to think critically. \nWith the Fourth Industrial Revolution presenting both huge opportunities and challenges, it is up to all of us to work together to ensure that it benefits everyone. Bernard Marr – strategic business and technology advisor – writes, 'Humans must be proactive in shaping this technology and disruption. This requires global cooperation and a shared view of how technology is reshaping our economic, social, cultural and individual lives.' \nIt is, therefore, important to establish ways that will keep the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution on track to benefit all of humanity. We can all individually have a direct role in shaping our future. \n\n[Adapted from www.salesforce.com, October 2020]\n\nGLOSSARY:\n1profoundly: strongly\n2segregated: separated or divided\n3adaptable: flexible",

    "passage": "FAST FASHION'S FOOTPRINT\n\n1 Fast fashion refers to the quick and inexpensive production of clothing by mass-market retailers in response to the latest fashion trends. The fashion industry is vibrant and varied. It has grown significantly in recent years due to the popularity of fast fashion. The goal is to get new clothing styles from the runway1 to the store as quickly and cheaply as possible to meet consumer demand for trendy and affordable clothing.\n\n2 'Clothing overconsumption is on the rise in Africa, including South Africa, and a major reason for this is the acceleration of the fast fashion cycle,' says Dr Lorna Christie, researcher at the Department of Life Sciences, College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences (CAES). South Africa is a fashion-conscious nation and it shows in consumers' spending habits. In one financial year, South Africans spent R180 billion on clothing and textiles, which amounts to 18% of all retail sales in that year. As a strong consumer base, South Africa is contributing to pollution because of the massive amounts of waste the clothing industry generates.\n\n3 Globally, fashion companies have drastically changed their release of new clothing collections. In the past, only two collections per year were available. Currently, some brands and fashion houses release two collections a month, or even more. This is also a growing trend in South Africa.\n\n4 With fashion changing so often and so fast, it is not surprising that people are buying more clothing. Globally, clothing production has almost doubled since the year 2000. People are buying more garments than in the past, and they only keep the clothes for half as long. The fast fashion cycle is increasing even more, and people are purchasing clothing at an even faster rate. They discard clothing at a faster rate too.\n\n5 The amount of clothing that gets thrown away every second of every day is equivalent to a truck filled with garbage. Discarded clothing contributes massively to pollution. The chemicals used in the manufacturing process are released, and because of all the synthetic fibres, clothes either decompose slowly or do not decompose at all.\n\n6 Natural fibres are not any better, because the cultivation of cotton and other natural fibres requires the use of water, fertilisers, pesticides, as well as the energy for picking the fibre and processing it into yarns2. Then, there is the dyeing process, which requires large amounts of water and chemicals, and the runoff3 from this process can pollute waterways4 and harm the environment.\n\n7 Washing clothes releases 500 000 tons of microfibres into the ocean each year, which is the equivalent of 50 billion plastic bottles. More than 10 000 litres of water is used when manufacturing a single pair of jeans. This is equivalent to the average drinking water for one person for five-and-a-half years. There is a further impact on the environment when garments are shipped and delivered to the point of sale as much fuel and power are used.\n\n8 The fashion industry has a damaging effect on the environment, but everyone has the power to drive the change that will reduce the impact. Fashion designers must use eco-friendly, long-lasting materials when manufacturing clothes. This will lead to sustainable fashion which encourages the repair, recycling and donation of clothes. Discarding clothes in a rubbish dump must only be done as a last option.\n\n9 Consumers must buy from sustainable5 fashion brands which do not produce clothes for the fast fashion market. They must support small local businesses which do not contribute to pollution. Instead of buying an outfit that is going to be worn once, it is better if consumers rent such outfits. People must ensure that their desire to look good does not have a negative impact on the environment.\n\n[Adapted from www.unisa.ac.za]\n\nGLOSSARY:\n\nrunway1: the long narrow stage that models walk along in a fashion show\nyarn(s)2: thread used for making cloth or for knitting\nrunoff3: rain or other liquid that flows off the land into rivers\nwaterway(s)4: a river or canal that boats travel on\nsustainable5: capable of continuing for a long time",

    "passage": "EMBRACING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\nThe words artificial intelligence (AI) seem to be on the tip of everyone's tongue lately. Artificial intelligence is one of the most important technologies in the world today. It has become part of our lives and it affects everything we do. Apart from the science fiction fantasies and images of robots taking over the world, what could be the reason for all the excitement surrounding AI?  AI is a field of computer science that allows machines to imitate human thought processes and decision-making abilities. There are different types of AI and the most common form is called 'machine learning'. Machine learning involves training a computer program on a large amount of data so it can learn to identify patterns and make predictions based on that data. AI is also used in industries to help automate1 tasks and improve efficiency.  Through the use of AI, individuals and groups enjoy a more personalised experience in various technological solutions. AI is used in a wide range of applications ranging from dating sites to online shopping. In Africa, it helps with solving important issues including access to healthcare, financial services and education. Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionise the way we live and work.  The impact of AI on businesses is resulting in a shift in the type of skills needed to drive economic transformation. In the past four years, the use of AI across businesses has grown by 270 per cent. However, regardless of the widespread anxiety about automation and machines displacing workers, AI is far from causing large-scale unemployment. It helps to simplify boring tasks and make workers more efficient. Besides making the workday less monotonous by removing all the redundant tasks, AI has lowered the entry-level to some jobs, especially for people who had limited access to education.  As the world becomes increasingly technology-driven, it is exciting to see how AI transforms the way we work and create websites. With user-friendly tools and platforms, like WIX, it is now easier than ever to design and create professional-looking websites, even for people who do not have a background in design. WIX, for example, offers a versatile platform that caters to users of all skill levels. Whether you are starting from scratch or working with templates, its artificial design intelligence (ADI) takes website design to the next level. You simply provide the ADI platform with basic information about your website needs and design preferences. ADI then creates a professional-looking website for you within minutes.  A popular AI tool that is commonly used is ChatGPT. This is a natural language processing model that allows you to have human-like ‘conversations’ with a chatbot2. ChatGPT can answer questions and assist with tasks like composing e-mails, writing essays and coding. It is popular among writers and people who work in advertising.  AI is increasingly influencing our lives in many different ways, for example health, fashion and beauty. The TikTok3 bold glamour filter is a video beauty filter that makes the user look more attractive. This filter is blurring the boundaries between what is real and what is not through the use of AI technology. Unlike past social media filters, bold glamour does not malfunction when the face moves in a video. It uses a database of other faces to create a new airbrushed-looking face. The filter has received over 400 million views since its initial release.  While AI is a powerful tool that can help us work faster and more efficiently, it is important to remember that it cannot replace human touch and creativity. It is also worth noting that AI cannot be used to cheat the system and should not be used to cut corners. Instead, it should be used to improve existing systems, to make them more efficient and effective. Despite its limitations, AI is here to stay and it can help us keep up with the changes in technology. By embracing its potential and using it wisely, humans can reap the benefits and work in ways they never previously thought possible.\n\n[Adapted from www.media24.com]    \n\nGLOSSARY:\n\nautomate1: to use computers and machines to do a job\nchatbot2: a computer program that allows humans to communicate with a robot\nTikTok3: a social media application that allows users to create, watch and share short videos",

    "passage": "TEXT A\n\n1. Research shows that humankind originated in Africa. Many of the earliest fossils of the world's ancestors were found in our land – and more specifically, at The Cradle of Humankind. The Cradle is 47 000 hectares of land in the North West Province, a mere 30-minute drive from suburban Johannesburg. The World Heritage Site is where many significant archaeological discoveries have been made, including Mrs Ples, the famous two-million-year-old skull found in 1947 in the Sterkfontein caves, and Little Foot, an almost complete skeleton that is more than three million years old.\n\n2. Unlike many other World Heritage Sites which are stagnant attractions preserved for visitors to peruse at will, The Cradle is an ever-changing and constantly active area. The discovery of the Sediba fossils by nine-year-old Matthew Berger, son of Wits professor Lee Berger, was announced recently. Matthew had found the first pieces of a partial skeleton of a young male child. Shortly afterwards, the bones of an older female were discovered. Professor Berger believes that these finds could tell us where the earliest members of the human species emerged from. A competition was held in schools to find an appropriate name for the young male fossil and it has since been named Karabo, which means 'answer' in Setswana.\n\n3. The amazing Maropeng Visitor Centre showcases and celebrates the evolution of humankind in all its glory. The extraordinary building is based on the theme of discovery. Maropeng is a word meaning 'returning to the place of origin' in Setswana. The centre is housed in the Tumulus Building, which is meant to resemble a giant burial mound or a buried fossil, with concrete 'bones' sticking out the top. There is a learner centre and hotel inside the development.\n\n4.

    "passage": "TEXT A\n\n1  In South Africa, more than 8 million children currently receive social grants from the state. The Department of Social Welfare regards 1,5 million children as orphaned or vulnerable, but only 500 000 of these children have been placed in foster care, leaving a large number still waiting to be placed. Another cause for concern is that 20 000 households in our country are headed by children. Only 1 900 children are adopted in South Africa every year. Poverty is often a root cause of child abandonment, threatening the hopes and dreams of these innocents. A mended pair of pants still shows its damage, and so it is with children who adapt to their environment but carry scars with them throughout their lives. Yet ever so often someone comes along and does a great patch-up job. They say home is where the heart is. For the children of House Jerome, in Irene, the joy on their faces is proof of this. At first glance, you would not know that many were abandoned in dirty toilets or on rubbish dumps.\n The family home of Basil and Dehlia Fernie serves as a shelter for abandoned babies and children seeking crisis care. Living in a household with ten children who are not your own seems like a job for an abnormal person. Why would anyone choose this lifestyle? For the past 28 years they have opened up their home to more than 300 children; nurtured and cared for them. Their purpose is to provide a stable place of safety which will help prepare these children for long-term foster families or potential adoptions.\n The Fernies are a happy couple with a good sense of humour. After many years of being involved in children's ministries, they established House Jerome as a means to help children in need. With four biological children already, their home became a playground filled with love and dedication.\n I notice Basil drinking coffee out of a mug with a picture of a teddy bear on it. What seems like a job that could truly drive a person insane is, in actual fact, the source of peace and contentment in their lives.\n One such example is the story of Jerome. At only ten days old, he was taken to House Jerome and set up for a possible adoption. It is just coincidence that the little boy carried the same name as the shelter. This encouraged the Fernies to adopt him as their own. Jerome was one of the first adoptions by a family from a different race. A decision that was unheard of before the 1994 elections has become a worldwide trend in recent years. Jerome confesses his upbringing was never focused around growing up with white parents. \"I am here, this is me and this is my home. My family is just as normal as yours.\"\n Jerome has had to face a number of challenges in his life, such as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD)*, academic failure and a struggle with drug addiction. Now 19, he is an optimistic young man about to write his matric. Dehlia notes that even though these children come with baggage, you cannot blame rejection for a child's wrongdoings. In the end, it was her love and commitment that saw Jerome through his teenage troubles. The family works closely with social workers to ensure a detailed screening process is done before all placements, and the majority are given the gift of a happy ending. While some come and go, for Basil and Dehlia the joy lies in seeing how the child has grown and knowing they played a role in making a difference.\n\n[Adapted from Center'd , Spring 2010]\n\nGLOSSARY:\n* Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) : A condition causing people not to be able to concentrate on something for a long period of time.\n\nNOTE:\n\n• All questions must be answered in your own words, unless you are asked for a quotation.\n• For one-word answers, write only the question number and the word.",

But this is not a problem for Monique Demé \nand Brian Pieterse, who volunteer at the Centre for Rehabilitation of Wildlife \n(CRO W). 'It is not glamorous but I do it for the love of the animals, ' Pieterse \nsaid.  \n \nCROW is a non -profit organisation based in Yellowwood Park, Durban. It \nrescues and rehabilitates abandoned, orphaned and injured animals. Animals \nin their care range from do gs to baboons and the odd mongoose. At CROW, \nanimals are nursed back to health and prepared for release into their natural \nhabitat.  \n \nA volunteer 's day starts at 0 7:00 with the preparation of breakfast for the \nanimals. This involves chopping fruit and veget ables. Demé and Pieterse \nensure that the animals are not fed like pets. When the breakfast run is over, \nthe duo clean the animals ' cages. Removing old and wet hay from the baboon \ncages every day is important because wet hay lowers the baboons ' immune \nsyste m. \n \nCROW has seven volunteers on its list, but ideally 16 people are required to \nensure that the facility runs well. Demé and Pieterse say the biggest challenge \nthey face as volunteers is releasing the animals back into the wild and not \ngetting attached to them during the rehabilitation phase.  \n \nFor Demé, the latest test of her emotional juggling skills will come soon. \n'Skippy, the black springbok, was here a week before I arrived. I have been \nvolunteering here for a year and I have got used to her being a p art of my life \nand now she has to go ... ' \n \nAnother challenge that CROW faces is ' baby season' , which starts in \nSeptember and ends in March. Space becomes a problem because most \nanimals give birth during this period, so the parents and their children have t o \nbe accommodated and this is usually when they need an extra pair of hands. \n'This is a problem with birds because they start hatching and then we have a \nlot of mouths to feed, ' Pieterse said.   \n   5 \n     10 \n     15 \n     20 \n     25 \n     30  \n     \nEnglish First Additional  Language/P1  4 DBE/November 2012  \n NSC  \nCopyright reserved  Please turn over   \n \n7 \n      8 \n    9 \n     10 \n       11 \n Many of the animals at CROW are at the facility because of people 's \nmisconceptions and because human beings invade the natural habitat of \nanimals. CROW recently rescued a monkey that was chained and almost \nstoned to death by peop le because they believed it was used for witchcraft. \n'People don' t know as much as they need to know about animals, they turn a \nblind eye because they think it is not their problem, ' Demé said.  \n \nMost people make the mistake of feeding wild animals. ' You s hould not feed \nthem because they will come back wanting more. They will get used to people. \nSome people get irritated and attack the animals. They should just call us and \nwe will take care of them, ' Pieterse said.  \n \nVolunteering at an animal shelter require s being passionate, hardworking, \ncaring and patient. It takes a lot of patience to deal with animals and people. \nCROW 's director, Samantha Terblanche, said volunteering strengthened one' s \ncharacter because it helped one contribute to society. It also helpe d to expose \none to work experience.  \n \nDemé said it was a free opportunity to gain life and job skills like work ethics \nand understanding job requirements. ' Volunteering shows that you have taken \nthe initiative. It is a pity that in a country where employment is scarce, the \nculture of volunteering is very weak. People do not realise that volunteering \neventually leads to employment. ' Demé added that it tested one' s level of \ncommitment and helped to develop one' s interests. ' This would hopefully help \nthem to do the job they loved. ' \n \n'The more volunteers we have, the better; because they are the lifeblood of \nCROW. Without them, we cannot run our operations. They are CROW 's hands \nand feet. ' To volunteer at CROW, you have to be 16 years or older.  \n \n[Adapted from DAILY NEWS,  3 October, 2011]   \n  35 \n     40 \n     45 \n     50 \n     55",
